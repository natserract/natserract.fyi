## Use Case

Building a media wall that displays personalised content based on user interests. These videos are sourced from platforms such as TikTok and are shown in a custom video player without watermarks or platform logos.

### Project Scope
- All back-end is built using Golang and the front-end using VueJs framework.
- Develop a custom component for TikTok video search and playback.
- Implement live background video searches based on user-supplied keywords without using official TikTok APIs or saving content to our own DB.
- Display search results and allow video playback via an open-source video player, using iframes or another embedded solution.
- Include features like:
  1. Custom search functionality
  2. Asynchronous background processing
3. Video playback controls (play, pause, volume)
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Prioritise performance using lazy loading and caching.
- Ensure cross-browser compatibility.
- Enable easy integration into other web applications with customization options to match the look and feel.
- Implement tagging and vectorizing watched content (audio/visual) to profile user interests.

### Expected Outcomes
- Functional custom TikTok search and video playback module embedded within a web application.
- Video search and playback occurring without direct user interaction with TikTok and avoiding API or IP bans.
- Metadata retrieval and video stream fetching upon selection of a video.
- Search results displayed in the open-source video player, without requiring a central server or TikTok login.
- Latest content no more than one week old.
- Fast and smooth performance through lazy loading, caching, and cross-browser compatibility.
- Seamless integration with existing applications and full customization support.
