This application is made as an intermediary between **Bus Agents** and **Customers**. Each bus agent has its own type of bus provider.

For example: Bus Agency - John Doe.

John doe is registered with the bus provider:
1. [Gunung Harta](https://gunungharta.com/)
2. [MTrans](https://www.mtrans.co.id/)
3. [Surya Trans](https://www.instagram.com/suryatransmalang/)

> Note: Agent registration must be done at the branch office manually. Not through the app

### Problems
The problem to be solved in this application is the main goal to unify all bus providers into 1 independent application based on the ownership of the Bus Agent ([unified APIs](https://www.apideck.com/blog/what-is-a-unified-api)).

### Challenges
1. Each bus provider has different APIs, such as: Model, Source, etc.

2. Synchronize/Matching each bus provider's scheme with our application scheme.

3. All the APIs of each provider are in the mobile app. So to get the right API and mechanism we need to extract/decompile their APK into readable code.

4. Not all APKs were extracted successfully.

5. Mobile First (PWA) - To get a mobile experience but all in one supporting all platforms. Plus with minimum budget

6. Hard to test, especially when testing transactions, every test either succeeds or fails. We need to pay for the transaction.

7. Race conditions problem when booking the same ticket simultaneously.
