## Overview
[Anekonnect](https://anekonnect.io/) is a whiteboard diagramming application purpose built to design and draw cables and wiring schemas for **subsea industry**

Focusing on engineering drawing components. My key contributions include:
- Migrating and refactoring the previous diagram library to a new one (MxGraph).
- Enhancing and developing drawing components, such as connectors and cables, using the MxGraph diagram library.
- Implementing state management with Redux to handle API integration and complex visualizations.
