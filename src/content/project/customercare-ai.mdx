## Main Flow
1. Accepts customer calls (inbound) via [Vapi](https://vapi.ai/)
2. NLU (Natural Language Understanding - Voice). Analyze user input to determine the user's intent (topic), which is the purpose or goal behind the message.  For example, Order Status Inquiry, Refund Request, Speak to Human, or ask a question.
3. Triggers an n8n workflow to:
    - Query order status from an API/database.
    - Email the customer if requested.
    - Any task required from customer
4. If the AI agent fails or is uncertain, the call is escalated to a human agent.

### **Technical Challenges**:
- Spelling variations and typos
- Multiple intents in a single message
- Industry-specific terminology and jargon

## Result

#### Achieved 96% success rate with low latency.
