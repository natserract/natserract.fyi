**Some people said**:
```bash
=> For backend services , I choose Golang's Gin over Node.js due to better performance + type safety + multiple out of box features.
=> Google's protos and RPC's for synchronous communication between  both microservices as it used HTTP2 & Proto-buf instead of JSON & HTTP1. Resulting in better performance and low latency.
=> Kafka for asynchronous communication for events.
=> Postgres Database with data replication approach.
```
