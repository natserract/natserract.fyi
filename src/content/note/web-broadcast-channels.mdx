The Broadcast Channel API allows basic communication between [browsing contexts](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Browsing_context) (that is, windows, tabs, frames, or iframes) and workers on the same [origin.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Origin)

**Some use cases for broadcast channels**:

* Detect user actions in other tabs
* Know when a user logs into an account in another window/tab.
* Instruct a worker to perform some background work
* Know when a service is done performing some action.
* When the user uploads a photo in one window, pass it around to other open pages.
