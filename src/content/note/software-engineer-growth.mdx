### Seniority

The framework to take you from junior to senior developer

**Junior - Senior Responsibilities**

**Junior**:

* Learn as much as possible
* Explore every part of the solution
* Listen and absorb all information from others
* Constantly ask for feedback and advice on how to grow

**Intermediate**:

* Take on as much work as possible
* Focus on going deep in one or two areas
* Become known as "The Person"
* Make mistakes, understand what went wrong, learn from it
* Get sh\*'t done

**Senior**:

* Become a great leader
* Know how to work with clients
* Focus on providing value, not output
* Understand every aspect of the solution
* Know how to get the most out of your team

**Junior - Senior Short Discussions:**

* Junior Eng: Complains about "the requirements not being clear"
* Senior Eng: Takes responsibility to figure out what the requirements should be. They resolve ambiguity and communicate well.

**Junior - Senior Short Discussions 2:**

* Junior Engineer: "I barely understand the problem, and I’m not even aware of how many tradeoffs there are or their possible implications."
* Engineer: "I understand the problem and have identified a number of tradeoffs, but I need a guiding hand to make the best decision."
* Senior Engineer: "I understand the problem and its root technical cause. I can quickly pick the best decision without any help."
* Principal Engineer: "I deeply understand the problem, have seen something similar in other domains, and can choose the decision that should prevent this problem from happening in the future."

**How do Senior engineers take features from start to finish?**

1. Ask why.
2. Identify Minimum Actually Viable Product.
3. Come up with the simplest technical solution.
4. Break the first milestone into tasks.
5. Implement feature flagging.
6. Roll out incrementally.
7. Validate assumptions and gather feedback.
8. Improve and work on the next milestones.

### Communication
As in many other professions, communication in software engineering plays a critical role.

Here’re a few ways of improving communication efficiency:
- Take notes during meetings
- Be concise and keep it simple
- Listen and think before speaking

### Categories of software engineers
There are two categories of software engineers:

- Process-oriented
- Results-oriented

The process-oriented software engineers are the ones who are too focused on practices and forgot why they are doing what they are doing. They insist that you aren't doing things properly unless you follow SOLID principles, TDD, DDD, or whatever other practice or principle is.

The results-oriented software developers will still follow the best practices, but only if it helps them to achieve their ultimate goal, which is to build good software that is easy to maintain.

The difference between these two software developer categories is the same as the difference between combat sports practitioners and traditional martial artists. Combat sports practitioners are concerned about winning a fight. Traditional martial artists, however, will say something along these lines:

"Yes, I might have been knocked out. But I still won because my opponent's technique was sloppy."
