1. Recognize when you're starting to burn out or get anxious is crucial
2. Saying “No” to anything non-critical in your off time.
3. Setting boundaries between work and the rest of your life. Remove notifications on devices.
4. Focus on your physical health as well. Fewer stimulants, more exercise, better sleep.
5. Put things in perspective. Will this matter in two years?
6. Educate yourself on mental health and emotional intelligence.
7. Listen more, assume less, and approach every situation with a bit more kindness and understanding.
8. It’s totally fine to be vulnerable. If you're feeling overwhelmed, don't hesitate to seek professional help. We’re all human.
