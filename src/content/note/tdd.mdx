TDD is a blend of all three: design, development, and testing. It’s an all-in-one methodology that enables developers to design simple, clean, and tested code. It’s a way to incrementally develop our software and comprehensively test all our business logic. It’s the gold standard way of producing quality software, incorporating best coding and design practices.

> _The more your tests resemble the way your software is used, the more confidence they can give you._

### Three laws of TDD:
1. You are not allowed to write any production code unless it is to make a failing unit test pass
2. You are not allowed to write any more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail, and compilation failures are failures
3. You are not allowed to write any more production code than is sufficient to pass the one failing unit test.
