Columnar storage is a data storage technique that stores data by columns rather than rows. This can offer significant advantages for analytical queries, particularly in read-heavy environments. However, handling multiple table relationships in a columnar storage database like Heavy.ai requires careful consideration to ensure both performance and data integrity.

## Benefits of Columnar Storage:

**1. Improved Read Performance**:

   \- Columnar storage is highly efficient for read-heavy operations because it allows queries to scan only the necessary columns, reducing the amount of data read from disk.

**2. Data Compression**:

   \- Columns often contain similar types of data, making them highly compressible. This can reduce storage requirements and improve I/O efficiency.

**3. Efficient Aggregation**:

   \- Aggregation operations are faster because they can be performed on compressed column data directly.
